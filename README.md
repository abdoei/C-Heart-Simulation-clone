# HeartSim
It is nearly the same as this repo [Medical-Cyber-Physical-System](https://github.com/abdoei/Medical-Cyber-Physical-System) but in C#, used `ChatGPT 3.5` for this conversion and took 2 days of debugging and language-specific rules of OOP and passing variables ðŸ˜­, probably I would do this faster but it is laziness anyway.
